TOPIC: INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTING
- The electronic computer is one of the most important developments of the twentieth century. Like the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century, the computer and the information and communication technology built upon it have drastically changed business, culture, government and science, and have touched nearly every aspect of our lives.

SUBTOPIC: DATA & DATA PROCESSING

WHAT IS DATA?
- Defined as any collection of facts. It is the information that can be stored and used by the computer program. This information may be in the form of text documents, images, audio clips, software programs, or other types of data. For example: data might include individual prices, weights, addresses, ages, names, temperatures, dates, or distances. Data is a raw form of knowledge and, on its own, doesn't carry any significance or purpose.
- Computer data may be processed by the computer's CPU and is stored in files and folders on the computer's hard disk. All kinds of computing devices such as tablets, PCs, or laptops feature a brain-like unit called the central processing unit or CPU. Your computer's CPU calculates and interprets instructions while you're surfing the web, creating documents, playing games, or running software programs.

WHAT IS DATA PROCESSING?
- Data by itself is not useful unless it is processed to obtain information. Data processing is the manipulation of data into a more useful form. It is the modern name for paperwork and involves the collecting, processing, and distributing of facts and figures to achieve a desire result. For example: Zebra-striped bar codes on supermarket items provide input that permits instant retrieval of outputs - price and item name.

WHAT IS DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM?
- Refers to the computer equipment, associated peripheral devices and procedures by which the result is achieved. Data processing is any process that a computer does to enter data and summarize, analyses or otherwise convert data into usable information. Because data are most useful when well- presented and_ actually informative, data- processing systems are often referred to as information systems.

DATA PROCESSING CYLE:
1. INPUT - The raw data after collection needs to be fed in the cycle for processing. This is considered the first step and called input. For example: keyboards, mouse, cameras and microphone.
2. PROCESSING - Once the input is provided the raw data is processed by a suitable or selected processing method. This is the most important step as it provides the processed data in the form of output which will be used further.
3. OUTPUT - This is the outcome and the raw data provided in the first stage is now “processed” and the data is useful and provides information. For example: monitor, headphone, speakers and printer.

SUBTOPIC: HISTORY OF COMPUTING & DATA PROCESSING OPERATIONS

THE EARLIEST COMPUTING DEVICES:
The earliest data processing equipment were all manual-mechanical devices due to the absence of electric and adequate industrial technology. Among the most popular were:

1. ABACUS - The first manual data processing device developed in CHINA. The device has a frame with beads strung on wires or rods and arithmetic calculations are performed by manipulating the beads.
2. NAPIER'S BONE - Invented by John Napier, a Scottish Mathematician become famous for his invention of Logarithms.
3. PASCAL'S CALCULATOR - Invented by Blaise Pascal, the first modern scientist to developed and build a calculator that could add and substract. It is widely known as "Pascaline".

DATA PROCESSING OPERATIONS:
1. RECORDING - IS THE TRANSFER OF DATA INTO OTHER FORM OF DOCUMENTS
2. MERGING - IS COMBINING ONE OR MORE DATA TO MAKE IT ONE USEFUL INFORMATION
3. STORING - IS THE SAFE-KEEPING OF DATA FOR FUTURE USE
4. RETRIEVING - IS THE PROCESS OF GETTING BACK INFORMATION FROM STORAGE
5. FEEDBACK - IS THE COMPARISON OF THE OUTPUT(S) AND THE GOAL SET IN ADVANCE
6. VERIFYING - IS THE PROCESS OF DOUBLE-CHECKING FREE FROM ERRORS
7. DUPLICATING - IS THE PRODUCTION OF DATA IN SAME COPY
8. CLASSIFYING - IS THE SEPARATION OF DATA ACCORDING TO ITS CATEGORY
9. SORTING - IS THE SEPARATION OF DATA ACCORDING TO AN IDENTIFIED MANNER
10. CALCULATING - IS THE ARITHMETIC MANIPULATION OF DATA
11. SUMMARIZING AND REPORTING - A COLLECTION OF DATA IS CONDENSED AND CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS FROM THE DATA ARE REPRESENTED IN A MEANINGFUL FORMAT.

SUBTOPIC: COMPUTER SYSTEM

WHAT IS COMPUTER?
- is a programmable machine designed to sequentially and automatically carry out a sequence of arithmetic or logical operations. It is an electronic system designed to manipulate data.
